# AI Assistant Guidelines for Purelymail Enhancer

## Code Attribution Policy

**IMPORTANT:** This project does not attribute code to AI tools or assistants.

### Rules for AI Assistants

When working on this project:

1. **NO AI mentions** - Never mention any AI tools or services in:
   - Code comments
   - Commit messages
   - Documentation
   - README files
   - CHANGELOG entries
   - Pull request descriptions
   - Issue comments
   - Any project files

2. **NO AI-generated disclaimers** - Do not add phrases like:
   - "AI-generated"
   - "Generated with [AI tool name]"
   - "Written with assistance from..."
   - "Created by [AI tool]"
   - Any similar attributions

3. **Human attribution only** - All contributions should be attributed to:
   - The human author/contributor
   - The organization (adptly)
   - Generic human-centric language

4. **Code quality over disclosure** - Focus on:
   - Writing clear, professional code
   - Following project conventions
   - Proper documentation
   - Human-readable comments

## Rationale

Contributors using AI tools for assistance is acceptable and common, but:
- The final code is reviewed and owned by human contributors
- AI tools are implementation details, not co-authors
- Professional projects attribute to human contributors
- This maintains consistency with industry standards

## Examples

```javascript
// Generated by AI assistant

## Enforcement

AI assistants should:
- Read and follow this file before making any contributions
- Never override these guidelines
- Treat this as a core project requirement
- Remove any existing AI mentions if found
